# ESX-driver-injection
Powershell script to automate community driver injection into a custom Vmware ESX ISO.
Please let me know of any issues. 
I don't take any credit for it since it was mostly AI generated, but one still has to give the right input to the AI, remediate any errors the AI makes, optimize the script and test run on multiple machines.

Uodated 09/11/2025: multiple drivers can now be added.
